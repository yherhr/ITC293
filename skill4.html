<h1 class="text-center"> Web Development Skills </h1>
<p>
I showcase my expertise in Web development through three distinct Shopify projects: www.rokiovertime.com, www.nutraviva.com.au, and www.cosmix.com.au. Each site exemplifies my proficiency in creating visually appealing and user-friendly e-commerce platforms. For Rokiovertime, I focused on integrating custom design elements and interactive features to enhance the user experience such as custom checkout layouts and a rewards system for retuning customers. With Nutraviva, I implemented SEO strategies and optimized product listings to drive organic traffic and improve sales aswell as helped optimise for a mobile viewing experience. For Cosmix, I utilized responsive design techniques and seamless navigation to ensure an intuitive shopping experience across all devices aswell as seamless integration with their spotify account to help with user interest. These projects highlight my versatility in web development, including skills in front-end design, and e-commerce optimization. <br><br> Feel free to click on any of the below images to navigate to the other sites.

            <p>RokiOvertime is my personal brand. I am actually present on a lot of the advertising material if you can spot me! - This website was the first one I ever worked on learning the majority of my skills here, from creating custom sections to display our products or integrations such as countdown timers within our banner. This was were it all started.</p>

            <p>Nutraviva was the first commissioned work I completed. The hardest aspect of this was working with a company that had preexisting marketing requirements for their website Aswell as branding assets that needed to be adhered too - this aspect of the work pushed me to really develop and push my understanding of CSS as the styling on the homepage needed to match their product lineup perfectly. not just this but as it was my first commissioned work i have also been competing maintenance work for any bugs that are found within the website - Feel free to contact the owners of the website to provide a reference of my professionalism during this project.</p>

            <p>Cøsmix is a small Sydney based band that I know personally and am helping them out to create a trendy website that reflects their music type - It is currently still a work in progress and is not completed however the main focus has been creating a wonderful looking mobile interface as most people interested in the band are younger individuals who compete most of their browsing on mobile devices.</p>
